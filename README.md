# Crypto_Arbitrage_Alert_System

This is an alert based crypto arbitrage system. 
Supported exchanges include: Binance, BinanceUS, Bittrex, GateIO, MEXC, Bitmart, OKX, Kucoin, Bitfinex FTX(Bankrupt)

You will need to add your own API keys for certain exchanges. Binance and BinanceUS APIs can no longer be accessed from the same IP due to location restrictions. 
Note: Certain exchanges may have made slight changes to their APIs so keep that in mind. This system has not been updated for over 1 year. I am simply making this repo public now.
